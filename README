chords2halftone.php is a completely standalone (non-Enano dependent) quick php
script which turns ascii monospace chord sheets into halftone markup. You may
or may not find it useful.

Halftone markup example:

<halftone title="Don't Stop Believing">
Intro: (E) (B) (C#m) (A) (E) (B) (G#m) (A)

Verse 1:
(E)Just a (B)small town girl
(C#m)Living in a (A)lonely world,
(E)She took the (B)midnight train going
(G#m)any - (A)where
</halftone>

You get the picture.

Halftone will position the chords exactly in the right position above the text.
You also (and this was the main reason I wrote this plugin) get automatic
transposition with ajaxy-smooth sexiness.

Note that the positioning-chords-above-text trick sometimes makes for overlaps
if you put chords so close to each other. An example would be using
"(G#m)any(A)where" in the sample verse above - depending on your theme/font
G#m would be directly adjacent to A (confusing) or A would even overlap. So
be sure to space out your lyrics accordingly.
